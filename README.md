# Topic of the thesis
The thesis is looking in to the possibilities and limitations of open-source dataloggers. As collections grow and funding for institutions like museums decline, the people in charge of the preservation of collections are faced with a dilemma. Preventive conservation tries to develop tools, like risk management, that can help to minimise the risk for damage and thus the need of frequent, laborintensive, and thus costly, conservation treatments. One important factor is the control of relative humidity and temperature as both can be the reason for damage indirectly through biological attacs and directly through phisical and chemical deterioration.
