Low-cost and accurate procedure for inspecting dataloggers
===
Monitoring the climate conditions in museums and archives is a standard procedure in many instituions. Though the sensors used for the dataloggers (i.g. capacitive or polymere humidity sensors) are vulnerable to hystereisis, drift and diminishing accuraccy due to polution. Thus they need regular calibration and adjustment or repair. 

Proper calibrations to check for a deviation of ervery sensor from a reference measurement are costly, thus it can be useful for museums and archives to inspect their instruments, used for general monitoring, in a more cost-effective way and pay for calibration, adjustment and repair only in cases, where it's needed.
Using saturated salt solutions can be an adequit solution for this problem. Though this method is not suitable for a proper calibration according to DKD-R 5-8, it is reccomended for general inspection purposes. 

The problem with salt solutions is, that the accuracy of the achived relative humidity depends on the ambient temperature, the sealing quality of the container and the pureness of the salt used. Thus a reference instrument is always needed for this process.

|Advantages|Disadvantages|
|----|----|
|low cost|not a replacement for proper calibration|
|relative accurate resultes possible|calibrated and accurate reference instrument still required|
|wide avialablity of materials and ressources required|execution, materials and equipment can influence accuracy|

# Materials and Equipment required

|Equipment|Quantity|Notes|
|---|---|---|
|Polypropylen-Box|3 (depending on calibration points)|- hydrophob polypropylen avoids migration of salts <br>- a good brand should be chosen to guarantee air-tightness (lock&lock seems to be adopted frequently) <br> - size depends on size and quantity of devices to be inspected|
|Inserts|depending on size and quantity of boxes|- are used to position devices inside the box above the solution <br>- could be 3D-printed or are sometimes included with boxes
|Reference instrument|1|- dew point mirror or electronic psychrometer => perfect <br>- capacitive hygrometer is also ok, but should be more precise than inspected devices <br>- regularly (once a year) calibrated|

|Chemicals|Quantity|Notes|
|---|---|---|
|Sodiumchloride|depends on box-size|75,2 % rH at 20 °C|
|Magensiumchloride hexahydrate|"-"|33,2 % rH at 20°C|
|Potassiumcarbonate|"-"|44,7% rH at 20°C|
